1.0: Introduction

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is a quantum field theory that describes the interactions between quarks and gluons, the fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons. It is the theory of the strong nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, meaning that the interactions between quarks and gluons are mediated by a force carrier, the gluon. The theory was developed in the 1970s and is now the accepted theory of the strong nuclear force.

QCD is a quantum field theory, meaning that it is based on the principles of quantum mechanics. In QCD, quarks and gluons interact through the exchange of virtual particles, called gluons. The gluons carry the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. The strong nuclear force is responsible for the stability of atomic nuclei, and is the strongest of the four fundamental forces.

QCD is a highly complex theory, and its mathematical description is beyond the scope of this introduction. However, it is important to understand the basic principles of QCD in order to understand the behavior of quarks and gluons. In particular, it is important to understand the concept of color charge, which is a property of quarks and gluons that determines how they interact with each other.

In this book, we will explore the fundamentals of QCD, including its mathematical description, the concept of color charge, and the behavior of quarks and gluons. We will also discuss the implications of QCD for particle physics and cosmology. Finally, we will discuss the current state of research in QCD and the prospects for future discoveries.

2.1: Quantum Chromodynamics Basics



Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is a quantum field theory that describes the interactions between quarks and gluons, the fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons. It is the theory of the strong nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. QCD is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and special relativity, and is the most successful theory of the strong force.

QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, meaning that the interactions between quarks and gluons are mediated by a force carrier called a gluon. Gluons are massless particles that carry the strong force, and they interact with each other and with quarks. The interactions between quarks and gluons are described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.

QCD is a quantum field theory, meaning that it describes the behavior of particles in terms of fields. The fields in QCD are the quark and gluon fields, which are described by the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is a mathematical expression that describes the interactions between the quark and gluon fields.

QCD also describes the behavior of quarks and gluons at high energies. At high energies, the quarks and gluons interact with each other in a process called quantum chromodynamics. This process is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.

QCD also describes the behavior of quarks and gluons at low energies. At low energies, the quarks and gluons interact with each other in a process called confinement. This process is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.

QCD also describes the behavior of quarks and gluons at intermediate energies. At intermediate energies, the quarks and gluons interact with each other in a process called asymptotic freedom. This process is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.

Finally, QCD also describes the behavior of quarks and gluons at very high energies. At very high energies, the quarks and gluons interact with each other in a process called color confinement. This process is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.
