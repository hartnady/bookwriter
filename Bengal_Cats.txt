2: History of Bengal Cats



History of Bengal Cats

The Bengal cat is a hybrid breed of domestic cat that was developed by crossing a domestic cat with an Asian Leopard Cat (ALC). The breed was first developed in the 1980s by Jean Mill, a breeder from California. The breed was created in an effort to combine the beauty of the ALC with the temperament of a domestic cat.

The Bengal cat is a relatively new breed, but its history can be traced back to the early 1900s. In the early 1900s, a British naturalist named Walter Rothschild began crossing domestic cats with ALCs in an effort to create a new breed of cat. This experiment was unsuccessful, but it laid the groundwork for the development of the Bengal cat.

In the 1960s, a breeder named Jean Sugden Mill began crossing domestic cats with ALCs in an effort to create a new breed of cat. She was successful in her efforts and the Bengal cat was born. The breed was officially recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1983.

Today, the Bengal cat is a popular breed of cat that is known for its beautiful coat and friendly personality. The breed is also known for its intelligence and trainability, making it a great choice for those looking for a loyal and loving companion.
